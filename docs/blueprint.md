# **App Name**: Dice Roller Duo

## Core Features:

- Dice Roll Simulation: Simulate rolling two dice and display the results.
- Dice Value Visualization: Display each dice result as a visual representation of the value (1-6).
- Sum Calculation: Calculate and show the sum of the two dice rolls.
- Re-roll Button: Provide a button to re-roll the dice.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to give a sense of chance and sophistication.
- Background color: Light indigo (#E8EAF6), subtly desaturated from the primary color.
- Accent color: Violet (#7E57C2) to draw attention to interactive elements such as the re-roll button.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern look. Use for both titles and body text.
- Use clear, minimalist icons for dice faces (dots from 1 to 6) to visually represent each value.
- Center the dice, sum display, and re-roll button on the screen for easy user interaction.
- Use a brief, smooth animation (e.g., a quick rotation) when the dice are rolled to provide visual feedback.
